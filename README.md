# Basic Portfolio

This basic portfolio was an exercise in HTML and CSS, which followed an assigned wireframe, with a bit of personal styling. This version was updated to include responsive design and media queries for different sized screens.

This project was created as an assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin.
